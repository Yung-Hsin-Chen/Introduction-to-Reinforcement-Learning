        "\n",
        "1. Initialise_game. The method initialises an episode by placing the three pieces considered (Agent's king and queen, enemy's king) in the chess board. The outputs of the method are described below in order.\n",

        "     \n",
        "     X: The features, that is the input to the neural network. See the assignment for more information regarding the            definition of the features adopted. To personalise this, go into the Features method of the class Chess_env() and change        accordingly.\n",
        "     \n",
        "     allowed_a: The allowed actions that the agent can make. The agent is moving a king, with a total number of 8                possible actions, and a queen, with a total number of $(board_{size}-1)\\times 8$ actions. The total number of possible actions correspond      to the sum of the two, but not all actions are allowed in a given position (movements to locations outside the borders or      against chess rules). Thus, the variable allowed_a is a vector that is one (zero) for an action that the agent can (can't)      make. Be careful, apply the policy considered on the actions that are allowed only.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. OneStep. The method performs a one step update of the system. Given as input the action selected by the agent, it updates the chess board by performing that action and the response of the enemy king (which is a random allowed action in the settings considered). The first three outputs are the same as for the Initialise_game method, but the variables are computed for the position reached after the update of the system. The fourth and fifth outputs are:\n",
        "\n",
        "     R: The reward. To change this, look at the OneStep method of the class where the rewards are set.\n",
